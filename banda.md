# **BANDA: Connectomes Related to Anxiety & Depression**
The Connectomes Related to Anxiety and Depression in Adolescents Project, also known as [Boston Adolescent Neuroimaging of Depression and Anxiety (BANDA)](https://banda-connect.github.io/index.html) is a collaborative effort among researchers at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), McLean Hospital, and Boston University. We will focus on understanding psychiatric disorders in adolescence, in particular those associated with two leading causes of death in adolescents and young adults (suicide and substance-abuse related accidents). Our research is guided by the “Acute Threat/Fear” and the “Reward/Prediction Error” construct.

## Overview

Population: Adolescents (14-16 y.o.) with depression and/or anxiety disorders (N=180) and healthy controls (N=45)
Goal: Probe RDoC constructs of acute threat/fear and reward prediction error with clinical, behavioral, and imaging measures

## Protocol:

Day 1 (at clinical site): Clinical interview, NIH toolbox & HCP behavioral measures
Day 2 (at Martinos): MRI scanning, additional behavioral measures (dot probe)
6-month follow-up (online): self-report web questionnaire
12-month follow-up (at clinical site): Clinical interview

## Clinical/Behavioral Protocol (Day 1)

Adolescent assessment (total duration: 4 hours)
Adolescent interview: Kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia (KSADS); Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)

Adolesent intelligence: Wechsler abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II) Full Scale-2
NIH toolbox:Dimensional Change card Sort Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, List Sorting Working Memory, NEO PI-R Neuroticism Subscale, Oral Reading Recognition, Pattern comparison Processing Speed Test, Visual Acuity
HCP: Penn Emotion Recognition Test, Penn Matrix Analysis Test, Penn Word Memory Test, Delayed Discounting Task
Parent assessment (total duration: 3 hours)
Parent interview: Kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia (KSADS); Weissman Family History Screen (FHS)
Parent self-and child-report: demographic questionnaire, Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire (MASQ), State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Mood and Feeling Questionnaire-Parent report (MAFQ-PR), Retrospective Measure of Behavioral Inhibition (RMBI), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)
Parent intelligence: Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI-II) Full Scale-2

## Behavioral/Scan Protocol (Day 2)

Dot-probe task - EyeLink eyetracker (total duration: 20 minutes)
Each trial begins with 500 ms fixation, followed by 1000 ms presentation of face pairs
Face pairs: one neutral, one emotional taken from KDEF database
Neutral and emotional presentation side (left/right) counterbalanced and pseudorandomly presented
Dot-probe side counterbalanced and pseudorandomly presented
Intertrial interval = 1000 ms (No Fixation)
Emotion Categories: Happy, Sad, Fearful, Angry, Neutral
Total: 128 trials. 32 trials per emotion. 32 different actors (16 female)
4 breaks for recalibration throughout 1 run
