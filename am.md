### **Project Overview**

Each year, more than **30% of the global population (\~2 billion people)** and **75 million adult Americans** suffer from conditions grouped under the umbrella term **“anxious misery.”** Despite available treatments, many individuals continue to experience **debilitating, chronic symptoms** lasting years or even decades.

This project responds to the **NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework** and focuses specifically on key constructs within the **Negative Valence System (NVS)**, including:

* **Loss**
* **Responses to Sustained Threat**

By jointly investigating these constructs, the study aims to disentangle the brain circuitry underlying these dimensions and identify more **precise therapeutic targets for disabling symptoms**.

### **Study Objectives**

* **Primary Objective:**
  Acquire and publicly share a comprehensive **multi-modal dataset** of brain imaging, behavioral, and genetic data from individuals with anxious misery, along with innovative analytical tools to study brain connectome alterations.

* **Research Hypothesis:**
  The **severity of responses to sustained threat and loss** will correlate with **distinct abnormalities in structural and functional brain connectivity**. These connectivity patterns are also expected to **predict the course of illness** over time.

### **Data Collection Strategy**

* **Participants:**

  * **200 individuals** with anxious misery symptoms
  * **50 healthy controls**

* **Recruitment Site:**

  * Outpatient Clinics at the **University of Pennsylvania**

* **Assessments:**

  * Neuroimaging using a **single Prisma 3T MRI scanner** optimized for compatibility with the **Human Connectome Project (HCP)** protocols
  * Behavioral and neurocognitive assessments including:

    * **NIH Toolbox**
    * **Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)**
  * Specialized clinical assessments targeting NVS dimensions
  * **DNA sample collection** for genetic analyses
  * **One-year follow-up** to assess symptom progression and clinical outcomes

* **Data Quality:**

  * Rigorous quality assurance (QA) procedures and harmonization with HCP data standards will ensure high data reliability and usability.

### **Significance**

* This project will create a **publicly available, richly characterized dataset** linking behavioral symptoms of anxious misery with brain circuitry changes.
* Findings will advance our understanding of the **neurobiological mechanisms underlying anxiety, depression, and related disorders**.
* Results will also provide critical insights into the development of **precision medicine approaches** for treating these complex conditions, based on individualized brain connectivity profiles.
