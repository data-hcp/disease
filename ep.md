### **Project Overview**

The **Human Connectome Project (HCP)** was originally established to accelerate the understanding of human brain organization through the acquisition and sharing of high-quality structural and functional connectivity data. The initial projects focused on healthy individuals, including twins and their siblings, to create detailed models of the healthy brain.

The **Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis** builds on this foundation by extending these efforts to the study of **severe mental disorders**, specifically early-stage psychosis. Psychotic disorders are debilitating brain diseases that often emerge early in life and frequently lead to chronic impairment and increased mortality. Translating brain connectivity research into effective treatments for these disorders has been slow and challenging, making this research critically important.

### **Project Goals**

1. **Acquire High-Quality, HCP-Consistent Data:**

   * Imaging will be conducted using **Prisma 3T MRI scanners** at two sites: Boston and Indianapolis.
   * The **HCP Lifespan Prisma protocol** will be used to ensure imaging quality matches that of the original HCP while reducing scan time for better participant compliance in psychosis cohorts.

2. **Comprehensive Data Collection:**

   * Structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data using advanced imaging protocols.
   * Behavioral and cognitive assessments modeled after the original HCP, with additional measures specific to early psychosis.
   * Blood samples collected for future genetic studies (stored at the **Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository (RUCDR)**).

3. **Advanced Data Processing and Analysis:**

   * Utilize the **Washington University HCP post-processing pipeline** for consistency.
   * Apply advanced imaging tools, including:

     * Signal drop detection
     * Multi-tensor tractography
     * Diffusion MRI models (e.g., free-water imaging)
     * Harmonization protocols for diffusion imaging

4. **Example Study Aim:**

   * Compare brain network differences between **affective and non-affective psychosis groups** and healthy controls.

### **Significance**

This project will create a publicly available, high-quality dataset combining neuroimaging, cognitive, behavioral, and genetic data in individuals with early psychosis. These data will provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying early psychosis and accelerate the development of more effective treatment strategies based on brain connectivity models.
