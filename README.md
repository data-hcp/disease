# Human Connectome Project (HCP) Disease Cohorts

Preprocessed and derived **diffusion MRI connectomics** resources from Human Connectome Project (HCP)-aligned disease cohorts.  
All releases provide *derived files only* (e.g., `.fib`, `.fz`) suitable for tractography and connectome analyses in DSI Studio and related tools.

> **NDA note:** Per NDA policy, **raw MRI data are not redistributed here**. After consulting with the NDA program lead, **derived data** (e.g., FIB/FZ) may be shared publicly. For other data types, request access via NDA. Once you have an approved **Data Use Agreement (DUA)**, contact us and we can provide a link to SRC files.
