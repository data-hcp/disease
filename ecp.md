The **Epilepsy Connectome Project (ECP)** aims to deepen our understanding of why some patients with epilepsy respond well to anticonvulsant therapies, while others develop **medically refractory seizures** and experience progressive brain dysfunction.

Using cutting-edge imaging tools, the project focuses on **quantitatively characterizing structural and functional brain connectivity**, with the goal of improving treatment strategies for patients with **Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE)**—the most common and often treatment-resistant form of epilepsy in adults.

### **Key Research Questions**

* How do recurring seizures over many years impact brain connectivity in TLE?
* How are brain connectivity abnormalities related to **cognitive and psychosocial dysfunction** in TLE patients?
* Can the severity of connectivity disruptions predict the risk of further cognitive decline and the development of medically refractory seizures?
